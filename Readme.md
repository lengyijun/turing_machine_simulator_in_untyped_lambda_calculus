# turing_machine_simulator_in_untyped_lambda_calculus

Simulator of 2-symbol turing machine, written in untyped lambda calculus.

The project can verify that untyped lambda calculus in turing complete.

Extremely slow, `cargo test --release` took 50 minutes.

See tests in `src/lib.rs` for a concrete example.
